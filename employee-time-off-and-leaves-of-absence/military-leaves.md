# Military Leaves

Per federal law, military leaves are available to eligible employees who enter the Uniformed Services of the United States, including the National Guard and the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service, or the state military forces, or the reserve components of the same, to participate in active or inactive duty or training. Time off is also permitted for an examination to determine one's fitness for duty in any of the federal military forces. Such leave will be granted in accordance with the Washington state and federal laws, provided all legal requirements are satisfied and the employee returns to work or applies for reemployment within the time prescribed by law. The employee must provide advance notice of the need for leave whenever possible.&#x20;

For more information on military leaves, please talk with the Executive Director.
