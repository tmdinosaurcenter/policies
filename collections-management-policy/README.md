### Background

Founded in 1995 with the intention of providing research and education about the paleontology, geology, and anthropology of Montana, the The Montana Dinosaur Center has continued to expand in order to fulfill this mission. In order to better serve the public and scientific community, TMDC will continue to grow and preserve the collection. \

This document was written out of the desire to both more faithfully care for the collection and be more transparent about methods to be accountable to the public trust.

### Applicability&#x20;
