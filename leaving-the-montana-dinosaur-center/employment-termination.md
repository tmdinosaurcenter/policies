# Employment Termination

We recognize that there may come a time when you need to change your employment.  If you voluntarily terminate your position with us, please provide us with a minimum of two weeks-notice, in writing, indicating your termination date. &#x20;

On or before your last day, the Executive Director will schedule an exit interview with you.  On your last day of work, we ask that you participate in an exit interview so we can gain feedback, insight, and knowledge from your perspective.&#x20;
