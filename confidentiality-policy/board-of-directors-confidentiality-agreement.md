# Confidentiality Statement for Board and Committee Members

It is the policy of the Montana Dinosaur Center that board and committee members of the Montana Dinosaur Center will not disclose confidential information belonging to, or obtained through their affiliation with, the Montana Dinosaur Center to any person, including their relatives, friends, and business and professional associates, unless the Montana Dinosaur Center has authorized disclosure. This policy is not intended to prevent disclosure where disclosure is required by law.

Confidentiality is the preservation of privileged information. Board members and other volunteers are cautioned to demonstrate professionalism, good judgment, and care at all times in handling any information related to the Montana Dinosaur Center to avoid unauthorized or improper disclosures of confidential information.

While board and committee members are expected and encouraged to discuss the organization with one another and targeted publics, they shall not report opinions expressed in meetings, nor shall they report independently on committee action, or engage in any communication that has not been approved by the Executive Director or that would not be supported by board policy, procedures, or decisions.

At the end of the board or committee member’s term or upon his/her retirement, resignation or removal from the Board of Directors or committee, he/she shall return, at the Montana Dinosaur Center’s request, all documents, papers, and other materials, regardless of medium, which may contain or be derived from confidential information, in his/her possession.

It is expected that board and committee members will not use trade secrets, client lists, or other confidential information acquired by virtue of being on the board or committee, even after they complete their service with the Montana Dinosaur Center.&#x20;
