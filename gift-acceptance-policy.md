### Policy Regarding Specific Types of Gifts

1. Gifts Generally Accepted Without Review: Unrestricted Gifts of Cash. TMDC will accept unrestricted gifts of cash without prior review by the Board of Directors, provided that, for donations of $5,000 or more, the identity of the donor has been vetted with respect to any reputational or policy issues. Unrestricted gifts of cash are acceptable in any form. Checks shall be made payable to the Montana Dinosaur Center. Solicited Gifts and Grants. TMDC will accept gifts, sponsorships and grants that have been solicited by an authorized representative of the association in accordance with section 3 described above, and the organization’s ongoing planning processes. TMDC reserves the right to make exceptions.
2. Gifts Subject to Board of Directors Review Prior to Acceptance. All other gifts, other than unrestricted gifts of cash less than $10,000 must be reviewed by the Board of Directors (or its designee) prior to acceptance, unless the Board authorizes certain gifts or categories of gifts to be accepted without its review. The following guidelines also apply:
   1. Tangible Personal Property: The Board of Directors shall review and decide whether to accept gifts of tangible personal property by considering the following factors:
      1. Whether the property furthers the mission of TMDC;
      2. The marketability of the property;
      3. The restrictions on the use, display, or sale of the property; and
      4. Carrying costs and possible liability for the property.
   2. Marketable Securities:
      1. Unrestricted marketable securities may be transferred to an account maintained by TMDC at one or more brokerage firms or delivered physically with the transferor's signature or stock power attached. All marketable securities shall normally be sold as soon as practical following receipt, unless otherwise directed by the Board of Directors.
      2. If the marketable securities are restricted by applicable securities laws, the Board of Directors shall make the final determination on the acceptance of the restricted securities.
3. Closely-Held Securities: Closely-held securities, including debt and equity positions in non-publicly traded companies, interests in LLPs and LLCs, or other ownership forms, can be accepted subject to the approval of the Board of Directors of TMDC. The Board of Directors shall review and decide whether to accept closely held securities based on the following factors: i. Restrictions on the security that would prevent TMDC from ultimately converting the securities to cash; ii. The marketability of the securities; and iii. Any undesirable consequences for TMDC from accepting the securities. If potential problems arise on initial review of the security, further review and recommendation by an outside professional may be sought before making a final decision on acceptance of the gift. The final determination on the acceptance of closely held securities shall be made by the TMDC Board with advice of legal counsel when deemed necessary. Non-marketable securities shall be sold as quickly as possible.
4. Bequests: Donors may make bequests to TMDC under their wills and trusts. A bequest will not be recorded as a gift until the gift is irrevocable. When the gift is irrevocable, but is not due until a future date, the gift will be recorded in accordance with GAAP.
5. Charitable Remainder Trusts: TMDC may accept designations as remainder beneficiary of a charitable remainder trust. TMDC shall not accept appointment as a trustee of a charitable remainder trust.
6. Charitable Lead Trusts: TMDC may accept designations as income beneficiary of a charitable lead trust. TMDC shall not accept an appointment as trustee of a charitable lead trust.
7. Retirement Plan Beneficiary Designations: TMDC may accept designations as beneficiary of donors’ retirement plans. Designations will not be recorded as gifts until the gift is irrevocable. When the gift is irrevocable, the gift will be recorded in accordance with GAAP.
8. Life Insurance: TMDC may accept designations as beneficiary and owner of a life insurance policy. The life insurance policy will be recorded as a gift once TMDC is named as both beneficiary and irrevocable owner of a life insurance policy. The gift shall be valued in accordance with GAAP rules. If the donor contributes future premium payments, TMDC will include the entire amount of the additional premium payment as a gift in the year that it is made. If the donor does not elect to continue to make gifts to cover premium payments on the life insurance policy, TMDC may:
   1. Continue to pay the premiums;
   2. Convert the policy to paid up insurance, or
   3. Surrender the policy for its current cash value. Donors may name TMDC as beneficiary or contingent beneficiary of their life insurance policies. Designations will not be recorded as gifts until the gift is irrevocable. Where the gift is irrevocable, the gift shall be recorded in accordance with GAAP.
9. Charitable Gift Annuities: TMDC may offer charitable gift annuities. The minimum gift for funding is $50,000. The minimum age for life income beneficiaries of a gift annuity shall be 66 years of age. Where a deferred gift annuity is offered, the minimum age for life income beneficiaries shall be 66 years of age. No more than one life income beneficiary will be permitted for any gift annuity. The Board of Directors may make exceptions to these minimums. Payment Schedule. Annuity payments may be made on a quarterly, semiannual, or annual schedule. The Board of Directors may approve exceptions to this payment schedule. Illiquid Assets. TMDC may accept real estate, tangible personal property, or any other illiquid asset in exchange for current charitable gift annuities. TMDC may accept real estate, tangible personal property, or other illiquid assets in exchange for deferred gift annuities if there is at least a five (5) year period before the commencement of the annuity payment date, the value of the property is reasonably certain, and the Board of Directors approves the arrangement. Handling of Funds. Funds required as reserves for gift annuities should be established and maintained in accordance with applicable Montana insurance laws.
10. Real Estate: Gifts of real estate may include developed property, undeveloped property, or gifts subject to a prior life interest. Environmental Review. Prior to acceptance of real estate, TMDC shall require an environmental review of the property to ensure that the property has no environmental problem. If the initial inspection reveals a potential problem, TMDC shall retain a qualified inspection firm to conduct an environmental audit. The cost of the environmental audit shall be an expense of the donor. Title Binder. A title binder shall be obtained by TMDC prior to the acceptance of the real property gift when appropriate. The cost of this title binder shall be an expense of the donor. Factors for Acceptance. The Board of Directors and legal counsel shall review and decide whether to accept real property based on the following factors:
    1. Whether the property is useful for the purposes of TMDC;
    2. The marketability of the property;
    3. Any encumbrances, leases, restrictions, reservations, easements, or other limitations associated with the property;
    4. Any carrying costs associated with the property, including insurance, property taxes, mortgages, notes or other costs;
    5. Any concerns which the environmental audit revealed.
11. Remainder Interests in Property: TMDC will accept a remainder interest in a personal residence, farm, or vacation property subject to the provisions of this Paragraph 4.

    1. Gifts of surface rights should have a value of $25,000 or greater.
    2. Gifts of oil, gas and mineral interests should generate at least $5,000 per year in royalties or other income (as determined by the average of the three years prior to the gift).
    3. The property should not have extended liabilities or other considerations that make receipt of the gift inappropriate.
    4. A working interest should only be accepted after consideration of potential liability and tax consequences.
    5. The property should undergo an environmental review to ensure that TMDC has no current or potential exposure to environmental liability.
13. Restricted Gifts: A gift with restrictions will be accepted only if and when the restrictions are approved by the Board of Directors.
14. Named Funds: A donor, or group of donors, may contribute and name a fund and restrict the use of the income or principal of the fund. Named funds require a minimum contribution of $50,000 and are subject to Board of Directors approval like any other restricted gift.&#x20;
