### Purpose <a href="#docs-internal-guid-d462e15a-7fff-c737-4077-3be6e84e43f0" id="docs-internal-guid-d462e15a-7fff-c737-4077-3be6e84e43f0"></a>

This policy establishes clear guidelines for documenting, approving, and reporting expenses incurred on behalf of the Montana Dinosaur Center. This policy applies to all employees and volunteers who use organizational funds or seek reimbursement for personal funds spent in support of Montana Dinosaur Center activities.

### 1. Documentation of Expenses

* All employees and volunteers must retain original, itemized receipts for every expenditure made with Montana Dinosaur Center funds or for any expense to be reimbursed.
* Digital copies (e.g., photos or scans) of receipts are acceptable if legible and submitted in accordance with this policy.

### 2. Monthly Expense Reporting

* A complete and accurate expense report must be submitted monthly, no later than the 20th day of the following month.
* Expense reports must include:
*
  * Date of each expense
  * Amount of each expense
  * Description of the business purpose
  * Original or digital receipts attached
* Reports must be completed using the Montana Dinosaur Center’s approved expense reporting form.

### 3. Use of Organization Credit Cards and Debit Cards

* Organizational credit and debit cards may be used only for legitimate, pre-approved Montana Dinosaur Center business expenses.
* Cardholders are personally responsible for safeguarding their assigned card and reporting any loss or theft immediately.
* Personal purchases are strictly prohibited on organizational cards.
* All charges must be documented with receipts and included in the monthly expense report.
* Improper or unauthorized use of Montana Dinosaur Center cards may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination or dismissal from volunteer service.

### 4. Use of Organization Checks

* Montana Dinosaur Center checks may only be used for authorized expenditures supported by adequate documentation, such as vendor invoices or contracts.
* Requests for check payments must be accompanied by appropriate supporting documentation.

### 5. Personal Funds and Reimbursement

* Employees or volunteers who use personal funds for Montana Dinosaur Center expenses must retain itemized receipts and submit a reimbursement request through the monthly expense reporting process.
* The same documentation requirements apply as for organization-funded expenses:
* Date, amount, business purpose, and receipts
* Reimbursement will not be processed without complete supporting documentation and proper approvals.

### 6. Approval and Processing

* Expense reports and reimbursement requests require review and approval by the employee’s or volunteer’s supervisor.
* The Montana Dinosaur Center’s Treasurer or designee will review and process all reimbursements upon supervisor approval.
* The Montana Dinosaur Center reserves the right to deny reimbursement for expenses deemed excessive, unsubstantiated, or non-business-related.

### 7. Compliance

* Employees and volunteers are expected to fully comply with this policy.
* Noncompliance, including failure to submit required receipts, incomplete reports, or misuse of organizational funds, may result in delayed or denied reimbursement, loss of card privileges, or disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment or dismissal from volunteer service.
