# Occupancy & Accommodations

Montana Dinosaur Center provides accommodations for summer staff as availability allows. This policy outlines the conditions which must be met to remain in good standing while you are using museum facilities. We want everyone to have a good experience working here and we all need to work together to make that happen.  Management provides the space and place for you to live while you are working here.&#x20;

### Trailers&#x20;

Trailer selection is first come, first serve. Due to the electrical setup and risk of fire, the use of high-power consuming appliances (AC/hot plates/microwaves, etc) is not allowed in the trailers.

### Move In

Upon moving into a trailer please make notes of things that are broken and/or not working so we can fix or replace as necessary. Trailers will be repaired as time and resources allow. If something serious is wrong please contact the executive director for assistance.&#x20;

### Upstairs&#x20;

* **Fridges**: There are 3 fridges upstairs. Feel free to claim and label a shelf or shelves in the fridges. The stainless ones are brand new in 2022. Please keep them in as good of condition as possible.&#x20;
* **Shelves**: You will have a shelf for dry goods in the pantry. TMDC is located in the country. Mice are a real problem. Please store your food appropriately in the provided plastic tubs.
* **Dishes/Cooking:** There are plenty of dishes and cookware in the kitchen for use, if there is a need for something additional, bring it up at a staff meeting so we can work to acquire said item.
* **Laundry:** The washer & dryer are right above the gift shop. Do not run them during business hours. If you need to dry during business hours on your days off there is a laundromat in Choteau.&#x20;

### Responsibilities

There are required responsibilities to make sure the facility is clean and sanitary. Maintaining the cleanliness of the upstairs is everyone's job responsibility.

### Rotating Schedule:

### Daily Cleaning

* **Garbage**: Must be taken out nightly (after everyone is done eating)
* **Stove cleaning**: Wash stove top to prevent grease from building up.
* **Sink/counters**: Kitchen sink and counters need to be cleaned nightly.
* Dish drying rack: Put away clean dishes on the shelves. Recommendation is nightly, but more frequency may be necessary
* **Dining Table:** Cleared off and wiped down. Maintain a clean space for people to eat.
* **Bathroom:** Sink and toilet cleaned. Quickly scrub them so they stay clean

### Non-rotating schedule

* **Dishes**: Do your own dishes after every meal. Dirty dishes are not permitted to be left in the sink or countertops. This has been an persistent problem in past years, so repeatedly leaving dirty dishes around may result in being written up, or further discipline.

### Weekly Responsibilities

* Sweep the upstairs living area and kitchen
* Shower cleaning
* Clean inside of microwave

### Vehicles&#x20;

TMDC vehicles are not for personal use without specific permission. They will regularly need to be filled with gas and given maintenance. They will need to be taken to Choteau or Great Falls to do that. When they are taken to refuel the vehicles may be used to get groceries, restock personal supplies, or perhaps go to see a movie. Plan to coordinate supply trips with other employees and volunteers. Please, don’t abuse the privilege.&#x20;

### Internet Usage

There are a lot of people using the internet at the museum, and the business of MDC has priority for bandwidth needs. Please be respectful and refrain from downloading large updates during prime times of usage. Torrenting, cryptomining, excessive bandwidth usage, and all illegal activities are prohibited on TMDC networks.

### Desk space&#x20;

Desks are first come first serve. There may not be enough for everyone. Please keep your stuff on your desk. And be respectful of other people's space.&#x20;

### General conduct.&#x20;

The Montana Dinosaur Center values cooperation and teamwork. Please keep this in mind when using our facilities. Be a good housemate and teammate. Give coworkers the benefit of the doubt, Help each other out and communicate with each other so that we all have a good time working here.&#x20;

\
The museum is small. The chances are we can hear what is going on upstairs in the gift shop. While playing games in your off time is absolutely fine, excessive yelling or swearing at your game is not acceptable. This is grounds for warnings, write up, suspension or even termination in accordance with the [Warning Policy](../performance-and-pay/warning-policy.md). Please be respectful of the facility, your colleagues, and our museum visitors.&#x20;

I have read and agree to abide by the Montana Dinosaur Center Accommodations and Occupancy Policy.
