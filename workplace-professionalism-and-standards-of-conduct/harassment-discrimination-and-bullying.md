### Complaint Procedure

If at any time you believe you are being subject to harassment or discrimination, or if you become aware of such conduct being directed at someone else, bring the matter to the immediate attention of your supervisor, the Executive Director or the Vice President. Choose the avenue which you are most comfortable with.  The door is always open to address concerns of harassment or discrimination.

Do not allow an inappropriate situation to continue by not reporting it, regardless of who is creating the situation. No employee, contract worker, customer, vendor or other person who does business with this organization is exempt from the prohibitions in this policy. In response to every complaint, The Montana Dinosaur Center will investigate and, if improper conduct is found, take appropriate corrective action up to and including termination.
