# Conflict Resolution/Grievances

All of us want to work in an atmosphere of mutual support.  However, sometimes problems or conflicts may arise which you cannot resolve by yourself.  If this should happen, we encourage you to discuss the situation with your Supervisor.  Every effort will be made to work with you and the parties involved to resolve the issue in a timely and equitable manner.&#x20;

For complaints about superiors should any problems arise, consult the Department Head of that area (i.e. Collections, Prep Lab, Payroll), or their supervisor.  An incident report will be filed by that Department Head and signed off on by the staff member.  If the problems cannot be resolved, or you do not feel comfortable approaching the Department Head, contact the Executive Director.
