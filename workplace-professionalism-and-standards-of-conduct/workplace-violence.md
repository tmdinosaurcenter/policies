# Workplace Violence

We are committed to a violence-free work environment, and we will not tolerate any level of violence or the threat of violence in the workplace. Under no circumstances should anyone bring a gun to work.

Threats, threatening language, or any other acts of aggression or violence made toward or by any The Montana Dinosaur Center employee will not be tolerated. For purposes of this policy, a threat includes any verbal or physical harassment or abuse, attempts to intimidate or to instill fear in others, menacing gestures, bringing weapons to the workplace (i.e. guns, or an item that is used to injure or purposefully hurt another person), stalking, or any other hostile, aggressive, injurious and/or destructive actions undertaken for the purpose of domination or intimidation.&#x20;

All potentially dangerous situations, including threats by co-workers, should be reported immediately to your Supervisor, or to any member of management. No employee will be subject to retaliation, intimidation, or discipline as a result of reporting a threat in good faith under this policy. If an investigation confirms that threat of a violent act or violence itself has occurred, we will take appropriate action regarding the offending employee up to and including termination.
