# Safe Workplace

The Montana Dinosaur Center is committed to the safety and health of all employees and visitors. Maintaining a safe work environment requires the continuous cooperation of all employees. If there is an on-the-job injury, report it to senior management immediately. A first-aid kit is in \<insert location> for emergencies.&#x20;

All employees are responsible for maintaining a safe environment.

By remaining safety conscious, employees can protect themselves and their coworkers. Employees are expected to promptly report either to their supervisor or the Executive Director all unsafe working conditions, accidents, and injuries, regardless of how minor, so that any potential hazards can be corrected.&#x20;
