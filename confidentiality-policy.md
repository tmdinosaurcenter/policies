# Confidentiality Policy

It is the policy of the Montana Dinosaur Center that board members and employees of the Montana Dinosaur Center may not disclose, divulge, or make accessible confidential information belonging to, or obtained through their affiliation with the Montana Dinosaur Center to any person, including relatives, friends, and business and professional associates, other than to persons who have a legitimate need for such information and to whom the Montana Dinosaur has authorized disclosure. Board members and employees shall use confidential information solely for the purpose of performing services as a board member or employee for the Montana Dinosaur Center. This policy is not intended to prevent disclosure where disclosure is required by law.

Board members and employees must exercise good judgment and care at all times to avoid unauthorized or improper disclosures of confidential information. Conversations in public places, such as restaurants, elevators, and airplanes, should be limited to matters that do not pertain to information of a sensitive or confidential nature.&#x20;

At the end of a board member’s term in office or upon the termination of an employee’s employment, he or she shall return, at the request of the Montana Dinosaur Center, all documents, papers, and other materials, regardless of medium, that may contain or be derived from confidential information in his or her possession. Confidential information includes, but is not limited to, our donors, supporters, employees, landowners, site locations, site discoveries, marketing processes, as well as our financial information, which includes current and future business plans, our computer and software systems and processes, personnel information, and associated documents.
