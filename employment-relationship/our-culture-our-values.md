# Our Culture, Our Values

“_Be the person your dog thinks you are._” – We hired you because we feel you are a good fit for our culture and you are a naturally good person. This keeps us all on a path for personal and business growth. The Dinosaur Center’s success is nurtured by our awesome people…kindness rules here!

_Work Smarter Not Harder_ – Be efficient and productive in your shift so the next shift is not overloaded. If it is easier for the next person, they can make it easier for you. “You scratch my back” …heard this before? Got an idea to make something better, voice it! Slacking is NOT permitted.

_Don’t Diss your Homies_ – If you are not pleased with a behavior or situation with someone at work, talk to them about it. Communicate! If you can’t discuss the issues yourself involve your immediate supervisor/manager. Don’t talk crap to everyone else, it gets ugly fast. If you absolutely cannot go direct, get a manager involved!

_Never Bail on a Teammate in Need, EVER!_ – If they are on fire, have a hose handy and be the first to put out the flames. Leaving someone in the lurch is never okay. On the other side, ASK FOR HELP if you are in the weeds, don’t suffer in silence, we are here to support and help where needed so you job feels awesome and the visitors are happy. Asking for help makes you smarter, not weaker!

_Complete Follow Through_ – Know your area of responsibility and stick to it until the job is done. Half-assed work will not be sufficient to keep your job at the Dinosaur Center; your teammates will eat you alive! Also, if you see someone that needs help, HELP!

_Keep Things Professional_ – Things get crazy behind the scenes, in the prep lab, and in the field; never argue, raise your voice, or curse in front of or in the presence of guests. The museum must remain neutral at all times, remember you are on show and visitors are watching your every movement.

Montana Dinosaur Center Representation – You always work for the Dinosaur Center…please don’t rob a convenience store in your uniform, or complain about a fellow coworker at the bar, or talk about how trashed you got last Friday with friends in earshot of visitors. We live in a small town where word of mouth does great good **and** great damage. We work with you because you are awesome, so just be awesome!

Elitism - Here at The Montana Dinosaur Center, we work to be the best at what we do. That doesn’t mean we treat people with less respect because they have less training, education or experience. Remember that everyone who works here is working to gain knowledge and experience. Be gentle and helpful with criticism and accept help and suggestions when it is offered. Do your best to not take constructive criticism personally.&#x20;
