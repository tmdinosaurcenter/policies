# Warning Policy

The Montana Dinosaur Center utilizes a warning policy approach dealing with job-related behavior that does not meet expected and communicated performance standards.  The warning policy process refers to the following actions:

1. A verbal warning accompanied by a signed form acknowledging the warning.
2. A written warning accompanied by a signed form acknowledging the warning.
3. Termination from The Montana Dinosaur Center.

These steps are usually taken in sequence when an employee exhibits behavior or performance issues. However, depending on the situation, any step may be repeated, omitted, or taken out of sequence. The Montana Dinosaur Center reserves the right to effect immediate termination should the situation be warranted. Each case is considered on an individual basis.

In the case of serious misconduct, an employee may be suspended and/or terminated on the first offense.&#x20;
