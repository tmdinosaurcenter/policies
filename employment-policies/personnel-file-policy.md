# Personnel File Policy

Employees may contact the Executive Director to request a time to review their personnel file. With reasonable advance notice, an employee may review his or her own records in the The Montana Dinosaur Center offices during regular business hours and in the presence of the Executive Director who is appointed by The Montana Dinosaur Center to maintain the records. No copies of documents in your file may be made, except for documents that you have previously signed. You may add your comments to any disputed item in the file.
