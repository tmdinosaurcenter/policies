# Attendance Policy

Excessive absenteeism and tardiness negatively impact our customers and the entire team. Absenteeism is defined as missing work without notifying your Supervisor in advance. Excessive absenteeism or tardiness may result in termination of your employment unless extenuating circumstances are proven to exist.&#x20;

Missing work without notifying your manager in advance for one or more consecutive days may be considered job abandonment and result in termination of employment.

\
If you must miss work or know you will be late, please contact your Supervisor as early as possible.  Unexcused absenteeism or tardiness may result in implementation of the warning policy. &#x20;

If you need to leave work during the workday (i.e. doctorâ€™s appointment, return home because of a sick child), we ask that you do your best to notify your Supervisor with as much notice as possible. &#x20;
