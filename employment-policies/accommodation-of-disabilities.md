# Accommodation of Disabilities

In compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), The Montana Dinosaur Center provides reasonable accommodation to all qualified disabled employees, upon request, so long as the potential accommodation does not create an undue hardship on The Montana Dinosaur Center.

If you believe that you may require an accommodation, discuss your needs with your Department Head. We may require medical certification of both the disability and the need for accommodation.

An interactive process is used to determine the best type of accommodation in each situation and whether the requested accommodation is reasonable.
